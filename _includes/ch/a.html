  <h2 id='chapter-a'>Appendix A: Setup and Install</h2>

  <p>
    The way you install Elixir is different on each operating system. It would be very nice if we could all agree on the One True Wayâ„¢ to install software, but alas, we do not. So below are the three major operating systems and their installation instructions, for your convenience.

  <ul>
    <li><a href='#mac-install'>Mac OS X</a></li>
    <li><a href='#windows-install'>Windows Install</a></li>
    <li><a href='#linux-install'>Linux Install</a></li>
  </ul>

    <h3>Code Editor</h3>

    <p>
      In this book you're going to need to have something to edit code with. I recommend <a href='https://code.visualstudio.com/'>Visual Studio Code</a> because it is easy-to-use and works across all the major operating systems. You should install it now.

    <h3 id='mac-install'>macOS</h3>

    <p>
      There's some <a href='https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#mac-os-x'>official instructions on how to install Elixir</a> but they're missing one key step: installing either Homebrew or Macports first.
    </p>

    <p>
      Homebrew and Macports are tools that help installing software packages on macOS. Homebrew is the more modern option, and so that's the one I would really recommend using here.
    </p>

    <p>
      To install Homebrew, copy the line from <a href='https://brew.sh/'>Homebrew's homepage</a> into your Terminal and run it. If you don't know where to find your Terminal, it's located in the Applications directory &#8594; Utilities &#8594; Terminal.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you've run that command to install Homebrew and it has finished, then run this one to install Elixir:
    </p>

<pre><code>brew install elixir</code></pre>
  </section>

    <h3 id='windows-install'>Windows Install</h3>

    <p>
      Windows is by far the easiest to install Elixir on. The <a href='https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#windows'>official Elixir install guide</a> recommends using the Elixir installer. All you have to do is to download it, click next a couple of times and then finish once and Elixir should be installed.

    <h3 id='linux-install'>Linux Install</h3>

    <p>
      There are too many varieties of Linux to list here, so instead I will link to the <a href='https://elixir-lang.org/install.html#unix-and-unix-like'>official Elixir installation instructions for Linux</a>. Follow those to get Elixir installed on your Linux operating system.

    <h3>Verifying Elixir is installed</h3>

    <p>No matter how you installed Elixir, verifying it is installed is done the same way across all operating systems. To verify that Elixir was installed correctly, run this command:</p>

    <pre><code>elixir -v</code></pre>

    <p>
      If this command says something like this:
    </p>

<pre><code class='hljs text'>{{ site.erlang_version }}

Elixir {{site.elixir_version}}</code></pre>

    <p>
      Then that means Elixir has been successfully installed.
