  <h2 id='chapter-12'>12. Conditional code</h2>

  <p>
    In <a href='/11-files'>the last chapter</a>, we have encountered a situation where our code can have different
    outcomes. Outcomes that we cannot predict from within the code itself. As an example, when we call
    <code>File.read/1</code> we could have two main outcomes:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>The file exists, and so the file is read successfully. We get back an <code>{:ok, contents}</code> tuple.</li>
    <li>The file does not exist, and so we get back a <code>{:error, :enoent}</code> tuple instead.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    We have dealt with this in the past by making our program crash if we don't get an expected value. We do this by
    pattern matching on the outcome that we expect.
  </p>

  <pre><code>iex> {:ok, contents} = File.read("haiku.txt")</code></pre>

  <p>
    In this example, if <code>File.read/1</code> succeeds then everyone is happy. We're <em>expecting</em> to get back a
    tuple here with two elements: 1) an <code>:ok</code> atom, and 2) the contents of the file.
  </p>

  <p>
    But if our expectations aren't met because the <code>haiku.txt</code> file is missing, then things aren't so great:
  </p>

  <pre><code>{:ok, contents} = File.read("haiku.txt")
<span class='console-red'>** (MatchError) no match of right hand side value: {:error, :enoent}</span></code></pre>

  <p>
    Elixir tells us that something went wrong and will refuse to do anything more about it until we give it different
    instructions.
  </p>

  <p>
    We need to cater for this sort of thing happening in the Elixir programs that we write. Sometimes, files are
    missing. The way that we can handle this is by using some <em>conditional code</em> within Elixir. Elixir has four
    main helpers for conditional code. They are: <code>case</code>, <code>cond</code>,<code>if</code>, and
    <code>with</code>. Conditional code allows us to give Elixir different instructions depending on what happens during
    the running of any Elixir program. Let's look at some examples.
  </p>

  <section>
    <h3>case</h3>

    <p>
      As we just talked about, we saw a case where file reading <em>could</em> fail. When we call this function, it can
      have two outcomes:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>The file exists, and so the file is read successfully. We get back an <code>{:ok, contents}</code> tuple.</li>
      <li>The file does not exist, and so we get back a <code>{:error, :enoent}</code> tuple instead.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In both cases, we get back a tuple, but what we can do with that tuple is dependent on what's inside. If we get
      back <code>{:ok, contents}</code> then we can carry on working with that file. But if we get
      <code>{:error, :enoent}</code> then we will have to make our program stop.
    </p>

    <p>
      One of the ways to get Elixir to behave this way is to use <code>case</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> case File.read("haiku.txt") do
  {:ok, contents} ->
    contents
    |> String.split("\n", trim: true)
    |> Enum.map(&String.reverse/1)
    |> Enum.join("\n")
  {:error, :enoent} ->
    IO.puts "Could not find haiku.txt"
end</code></pre>

    <aside>
      <header>Where did the backslashes go?</header>
      <p>
        Note that we don't need use backslashes (<code>\</code>) in this code for the piping lines (the ones with
        <code>|&gt;</code>) because Elixir will wait until the <code>end</code> of the <code>case</code> to run this
        code. Elixir can't know what to do until it sees that <code>end</code>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we left off the backslashes in code from previous chapters, Elixir would choose to run those lines
        one-by-one. This is opposite to what we want. We want it to chain the functions together in a pipe-chain.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <aside>
      <header>Blocks of code</header>

      <p>
        In the last aside, I mentioned that Elixir will wait until the <code>end</code> to execute the code, but it
        might be helpful to know where it starts waiting from too. Elixir starts waiting from the <code>do</code> at the
        end of our <code>case</code> line.
      </p>

      <p>
        This <code>do</code> and <code>end</code> combination is often referred to as a <em>block</em>. You can think of
        blocks as another type of argument in Elixir. It might be helpful to know this word when reading what other
        people write about Elixir, as it comes up from time to time.
      </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
      This case statement uses much of the same code we saw in the previous chapter, but now goes different routes
      depending on the output of <code>File.read/1</code>. If <code>File.read/1</code> returns something that matches
      the pattern of <code>{:ok, contents}</code>, then our file's code will be parsed and reversed correctly, resulting
      in this output:
    </p>

    <pre><code>"I love Elixir\nIt is so easy to learn\nGreat functional code"</code></pre>

    <p>
      However, if that <code>File.read/1</code> call results in something that matches <code>{:error, :enoent}</code>,
      then we will see an error message telling us that we couldn't find that file.
    </p>

    <pre><code>Could not find haiku.txt</code></pre>

    <p>
      These two "forks in the road" for this <code>case</code> statement are referred to as <em>clauses</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might recognise this code as being similar to a function we defined back in Chapter 6:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> road = fn
  "high" -> "You take the high road!"
  "low" -> "I'll take the low road! (and I'll get there before you)"
  _ -> "Take the 'high' road or the 'low' road, thanks!"
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      This is because it is the same underlying principle. We're using pattern matching inside the <code>case</code> in
      this chapter to determine what to do, just like we did in that function 6 chapters ago. Before the
      <code>-&gt;</code> we tell Elixir what we want to match. Then after that, we tell it what we want to do once that
      match happens. In our case statement, we put that "after" code on separate lines and this is just to increase
      readability of the code. We could've done the same in our function too:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> road = fn
  "high" ->
    "You take the high road!"
  "low" ->
    "I'll take the low road! (and I'll get there before you)"
  _ ->
    "Take the 'high' road or the 'low' road, thanks!"
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      You might notice that in this function block, we have the catch-all clause at the end (<code>_ -></code>). This is
      the last-ditch effort for the function to do something. It's worth knowing that we could do the same thing in our
      <code>case</code> statements too:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> case File.read("haiku.txt") do
  {:ok, contents} ->
    contents
    |> String.split("\n", trim: true)
    |> Enum.map(&String.reverse/1)
    |> Enum.join("\n")
  {:error, :enoent} ->
    IO.puts "Could not find haiku.txt"
  _ ->
    IO.puts "Something unexpected happened, please try again."
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      In this code, if Elixir sees something that is not known to the <code>case</code> statement then it will give us a
      completely different message. While we're on this topic of catch-all clauses, I want to show you one more precise
      way of doing this too:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> case File.read("haiku.txt") do
  {:ok, contents} ->
    contents
    |> String.split("\n", trim: true)
    |> Enum.map(&String.reverse/1)
    |> Enum.join("\n")
  {:error, :enoent} ->
    IO.puts "Could not find haiku.txt"
  {:error, _} ->
    IO.puts "Something unexpected happened, please try again."
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      This time, our last clause will <em>not</em> match everything and anything. It will only match tuples that have
      <em>exactly</em> two items in them, and the first item <em>must</em> be <code>:error</code>. As we can see here,
      this is using the <em>pattern matching</em> feature in Elixir that we've seen a few times throughout this book
      already. The tuple for the last clause isn't <em>exactly</em> <code>{:error, _}</code>, but it is something that
      is in the same pattern. This pattern matching is why the last clause would match any other error that may be
      returned from <code>File.read/1</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is a better approach, because it is clearer to anyone else seeing this code what we might expect when
      something unexpected happens.
    </p>

    <p>
      Now we know Elixir has two places where these clauses are used: functions and <code>case</code> blocks. We're
      about to see another one.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>cond</h3>

    <p>
      The <code>case</code> statement is good to use if you want to compare the outcome of one particular action and do
      different things depending on whatever that outcome is. In the last section, that outcome was the output of a
      <code>File.read/1</code> function call.
    </p>

    <p>
      What we'll see in this section is that <code>case</code> has a cousin called <code>cond</code> which provides us a
      way of checking multiple conditions (<code>cond</code> is short for "condition"), and then running some code for
      whatever clause is true. Here's a quick example:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> num = 50
50
iex> cond do
  num &lt; 50 -> IO.puts "Number is less than 50"
  num &gt; 50 -> IO.puts "Number is greater than 50"
  num == 50 -> IO.puts "Number is exactly 50"
end
Number is exactly 50
:ok</code></pre>

    <p>
      Izzy asks: "What does <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>==</code> mean? We've never seen those
      before!" Yes! This is the first time in twelve chapters that we've seen these things. Now is a great time to cover
      what they do. <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code> and <code>==</code> are ways to compare two values in Elixir.
      You can probably guess from the code that <code>&lt;</code> means "less than", <code>&gt;</code> means "greater
      than", and that <code>==</code> is "exactly equal to". But what is this code actually doing?
    </p>

    <p>
      If we take the comparisons out of the <code>cond</code> and run them individually, we'll have a clearer picture of
      what this code is doing:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> num &gt; 50
false
iex> num &lt; 50
false
iex> num == 50
true</code></pre>

    <p>
      These comparisons are going to compare the two values and then tell us if those comparisons are <code>true</code>
      or <code>false</code>. This is our first exposure to code that outputs either <code>true</code> or
      <code>false</code>. Think of it like this: if we were to ask the question of "is <code>num</code> equal to 50",
      what would the answer be? We would normally say "yes, it is equal". Elixir's version of an answer to this question
      is <code>true</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      When we use these comparisons in <code>cond</code>, the first clause where the comparison results in
      <code>true</code> will execute that clause's code. Go ahead and change the number in the <code>cond</code> code
      above to see how it might react to those changes.
    </p>

  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>if, else and unless</h3>

    <p>
      Now that we've seen what <code>case</code> and <code>cond</code> can do, let's look at two more related
      conditional statements: <code>if</code> and <code>unless</code> and their compatriot <code>else</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The <code>cond</code> statement was really helpful if we had multiple conditions to compare against. In the
      previous code, we wanted to check if the number was less than, greater than or exactly equal to 50:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> num = 50
50
iex> cond do
       num &lt; 50 -> IO.puts "Number is less than 50"
       num &gt; 50 -> IO.puts "Number is greater than 50"
       num == 50 -> IO.puts "Number is exactly 50"
     end
Number is exactly 50
:ok</code></pre>

    <p>
      But what if we only wanted to check if the number was exactly 50? Well, we could remove the first two clauses from
      this <code>cond</code> statement:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> cond do
       num == 50 -> IO.puts "Number is exactly 50"
     end
Number is exactly 50
:ok</code></pre>

    <p>
      This is one way of writing this code and it will work perfectly fine. However, if the number was <em>not</em> 50,
      then we would see an error come from this code:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> num = 10
10
iex> cond do
       num == 50 -> IO.puts "Number is exactly 50"
     end
<span class="console-red">** (CondClauseError) no cond clause evaluated to a true value</span></code></pre>

    <p>
      This is happening because <code>cond</code> always requires at least one of its conditions to evaluate to a
      <code>true</code> value. In the code we've just attempted, <code>num == 50</code> will be <code>false</code>, not
      <code>true</code>, and because it is the only clause in this <code>cond</code> we will see this error.
    </p>

    <p>
      If we've got code like this in Elixir where we're running code conditionally and we don't want Elixir to show us
      big scary error messages like this one, we should be using <code>if</code> instead. Let's look at how we could
      attempt the same code with <code>if</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> num = 10
10
iex> if num == 50 do
        IO.puts "Number is exactly 50"
      end
nil</code></pre>

    <p>
      Because the condition here is not <code>true</code>, nothing happens. The way that Elixir represents nothing is
      with <code>nil</code>. We asked Elixir to only execute code if the condition is true, but it wasn't. So
      <code>nil</code> is the outcome.
    </p>

    <h4>unless</h4>

    <p>
      Now we've seen how to do something if a particular condition is true, but what happens if we want to do something
      if it is false? For this, Elixir gives us <code>unless</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> num = 10
10
iex> unless num == 50 do
        IO.puts "Number is not 50"
      end
Number is not 50
:ok</code></pre>

    <p>
      In this short example, Elixir will output our "Number is not 50" message if the number is not 50. If the number is
      50, then nothing (<code>nil</code>) will be the result of this code.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you're unsure of whether to use <code>if</code> or <code>unless</code>, try reading the code out loud. Does it
      make more sense to say "unless the number is equal to 50"? In this case, yes it does. But let's try another
      example:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> num = 10
10
iex> unless num != 50 do
        IO.puts "Number is 50"
      end
Number is 50
:ok</code></pre>

    <p>
      This time, the code reads in English as "unless the number is not equal (<code>!=</code>) to 50". This sentence
      contains a double negative with the use of "unless" and "not", and so using <code>unless</code> in this example is
      unsuitable. The code should use an <code>if</code> instead:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> num = 50
50
iex> if num == 50 do
       IO.puts "Number is 50"
     end
Number is 50
:ok</code></pre>

    <p>
      Now the code reads as "if the number is equal to 50", and that makes a lot more sense!
    </p>

    <h4>else</h4>

    <p>
      We've now seen <code>if</code> and its opposite <code>unless</code>, but what if we wanted to do <code>if</code>
      <em>and</em> <code>unless</code> at the same time? What if we wanted Elixir to do some code if a particular
      condition was true, but then do some other code if it wasn't true?
    </p>

    <p>
      For this, Elixir gives us <code>else</code>:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> num = 10
10
iex> if num == 50 do
       IO.puts "Number is 50"
     else
       IO.puts "Number is not 50"
     end
Number is not 50
:ok</code></pre>

    <p>
      This would read like: "if the number is 50, show 'Number is 50', otherwise, show 'Number is not 50'". In this
      code, our number is <em>not</em> 50, and so we see Elixir tell us that.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3>with</h3>

    <p>
      There's one more feature of Elixir to do with conditional code that I would love to show you before we finish off
      this chapter. It is called <code>with</code>. The <code>with</code> feature allows us to chain together multiple
      operations, and only continue if each of those operations is successful. Before we look at how to use
      <code>with</code>, let's look at the type of problem it is good at solving.
    </p>

    <p>
      Let's say that we had somehow came across a map containing this data in our travels:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> file_data = %{name: "haiku.txt"}</code></pre>

    <p>
      This map is designed to tell us what file to read our haiku from. This map contains a single key which is the atom
      <code>:name</code>, and its value is the string "haiku.txt". So we could know by accessing the name key in this
      map what file to read from. Here's one way we could do it:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> File.read(file_data["name"])
{:ok, "rixilE evol I..."}</code></pre>

    <p>
      But what would happen here if the map <em>didn't</em> contain this key, but instead a differently named key? Then
      our code would break:
    </p>

    <pre><code>iex> file_data = %{filename: "haiku.txt"}
%{filename: "haiku.txt"}
iex> File.read(file_data["name"])
{:error, :enoent}</code></pre>

    <p>
      Our programs need to be written in such a way to protect against this sort of thing. In this particular case, we
      must make them expect to read a value from a key called <code>:name</code>, not <code>:filename</code>. Once it
      has done that, then it can try to read that file.
    </p>

    <p>
      One way to write this would be to use a <code>case</code> statement inside another <code>case</code> statement,
      like this:
    </p>

    <pre><code>file_data = %{name: "haiku.txt"}
case Map.fetch(file_data, :name) do
  {:ok, name} ->
    case File.read(name) do
      {:ok, contents} ->
        contents
        |> String.split("\n", trim: true)
        |> Enum.map(&String.reverse/1)
        |> Enum.join("\n")
      {:error, :enoent} ->
        IO.puts "Could not find a file called #{name}"
    end
  :error -> "No key called :name in file_data map"
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      In this code, we attempt to find the <code>:name</code> key in <code>file_data</code> with
      <code>Map.fetch/2</code>. This <code>Map.fetch/2</code> function is new to us here, and so we'll quickly cover
      what it does.
    </p>

    <p>
      The way <code>Map.fetch/2</code> works is that if there is a key in the map then <code>Map.fetch/2</code> will
      return <code>{:ok, name}</code>. If there isn't, it will return the atom <code>:error</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      We pattern match on either of these two outcomes during this <code>case</code> statement. In this example, there
      is going to be a <code>:name</code> key, and so it will match the <code>{:ok, name}</code> part of our case
      statement. Then the second <code>case</code> statement will come into effect.
    </p>

    <p>
      This second case statement attempts to read a file using <code>File.read/1</code>. If this file exists, then this
      function will return <code>{:ok, contents}</code>. If the file does not exist, <code>{:error, :enoent}</code> will
      be returned instead. In this case, we know that the file exists from our previous attempts at reading it, and so
      this code will execute successfully.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code is a little hard to read, as we need to really focus to keep our mind on where we are in the code. A
      <code>with</code> statement can simplify this code:
    </p>

    <pre><code>with {:ok, name} &lt;- Map.fetch(file_data, :name),
     {:ok, contents} &lt;- File.read(name) do
  contents
  |> String.split("\n", trim: true)
  |> Enum.map(&String.reverse/1)
  |> Enum.join("\n")
  |> IO.puts
else
  :error -> ":name key missing in file_data"
  {:error, :enoent} -> "Couldn't read file"
end</code></pre>

    <p>
      In Elixir, <code>with</code> statements are to be read like a series of instructions of what to do when everything
      goes <em>right</em>. In this example, if <code>Map.fetch/2</code> succeeds and returns <code>{:ok, name}</code>,
      then Elixir will be able to use it in the next step, when it calls <code>File.read/1</code>. After that, our code
      will work as intended.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, if <code>Map.fetch/2</code> fails, then <code>:error</code> will be returned. We handle that in the
      <code>else</code> inside this <code>with</code> block, telling <code>with</code> that if we see
      <code>:error</code> returned, that we want to see an error message saying that the <code>:name</code> key was
      missing. Then if <code>File.read/1</code> fails and returns <code>{:error, :enoent}</code>, then we want it to
      tell us that it couldn't read the file.
    </p>

    <p>
      This code is a little neater than the double-<code>case</code> code because all of our code that deals with the
      <em>success</em> of our program is grouped neatly at the top, and all the code that deals with the
      <code>failure</code> is grouped at the bottom.
    </p>

    <p>
      I would encourage you to play around here with the <code>with</code> statement to get a better understanding of
      it. What happens if you change <code>file_data</code> so that it doesn't have a <code>:name</code> key? What
      happens if that <code>haiku.txt</code> file goes missing?
    </p>
